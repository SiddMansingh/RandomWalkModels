# ezh5-eigen: C++ interface for HDF5 with Eigen3 support
Theoretically simple and straightforward to use C++11 to HDF5 library.  
Based off of [mileschen360/ezh5](https://github.com/mileschen360/ezh5/)

## Features
* Reading/writing of basic data types (`int`,`double`,`std::complex<T>`,`std::string`)
* Reading/writing of Eigen vectors and matrices (e.g. `Eigen::VectorXd`, `Eigen::Matrix Xcd`)
* Appending of basic data types into vectors
* Appending of Eigen vectors into a "matrix"
