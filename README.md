## Exact Diagonalization Prerequisites
### Creation of Basis States and Lin Tables for easy reference
Before creating operations of the Hamiltonian, one needs to create basis states. The most crucial part is to find the index of a given configuration. A naive approach would be to raise the $i^{th}$
## Features
* Reading/writing of basic data types (`int`,`double`,`std::complex<T>`,`std::string`)
* Reading/writing of Eigen vectors and matrices (e.g. `Eigen::VectorXd`, `Eigen::Matrix Xcd`)
* Appending of basic data types into vectors
* Appending of Eigen vectors into a "matrix"
